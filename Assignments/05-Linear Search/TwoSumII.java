/* Two Sum II - input array is sorted
You're given a 1-indexed array sorted in non-decreasing order, and a target value.

Goal:
Find two numbers such that their sum equals the target.
Return their indices (index1, index2) as [index1, index2] (1-based).

Note:
- Exactly one solution exists.
- The same element cannot be used twice.

Example:
numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 â†’ Output: [1,2] (2 + 7 = 9)
