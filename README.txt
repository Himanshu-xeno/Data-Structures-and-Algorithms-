Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

This repository contains my complete DSA journey using Java — from fundamentals to advanced problem-solving — inspired by:

- Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet
- Kunal Kushwaha’s Java DSA Playlist

Folder Structure:

DSA-intelliJ/
├── Assignments/             → Practice problems and custom exercises
├── Chapters/                → Well-structured topics like Arrays, Recursion, etc.
├── A2Z Sheet/               → Solutions from Striver’s A2Z Sheet
└── README.txt               → You're reading this!

What I’m Covering:

- Arrays, Strings, Recursion, Patterns
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection)
- Binary Search (1D & 2D), Bit Manipulation
- Functions, Loops, Conditionals
- Hashing, Time & Space Complexity
- More will be added as I keep learning

Why This Repo?

- To track my daily DSA progress
- For revision and clean file organization
- To share my journey while building in public

Tools Used:

- Java (using IntelliJ IDEA)
- VS Code (for Git and quick edits)
- Git + GitHub for version control
